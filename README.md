# siege_mask_rnn

Link to download the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TZJv8uxdIkIJd5nane7OXbVQNWDmCl_T?usp=sharing)

Trained a mask R-CNN model on a custom rainbow six siege dataset. For more details check out my medium posts https://medium.com/@michaelsugimura

This repo is mostly a modification on the matterport mask r-cnn repo 

~~I was not able to include the model files or image dataset, I would be happy to provide them if anyone ends up being interested. ~~

Got around to uploading them somewhhere so [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TZJv8uxdIkIJd5nane7OXbVQNWDmCl_T) is a link to the dataset stored on google Drive. 

-siege_output folder contains some sample images that I passed through the model to see how it was performing

-mrcnn contains the util and model files for running the network. These are from matterport

-the siege_m_rcnn.py file is my modification of their balloon sample

-the inspection file is also a modified version of the balloon sample
